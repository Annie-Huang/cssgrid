The one with the "new" in the file name are the ones created by myself.

At 5:03. Need to make sure you have the latest of chrome, e.g. Version 60.0.3112.90 so it supports grid. Otherwise you won't see it as two columns.

            grid-template-columns: 70% 30%;
            grid-template-columns: 40% 30% 30%;

fr stands for fraction.
Recommand to use fr over percentage and pixels


Horizontal alignment:
justify-items: stretch;     Can be start, center, end, stretch(default).

Vertical alignment:
align-items: start;     Can be start, center, end, stretch(default).

grid-column: 1/3;
means box1 will cover from vertical line1 to vertical line3 (incolumns), refers to "CSS Grids blackIsHorizontalLineNo greyIsVerticalLineNo.png". And it will knock off box2
same concept for grid-row: 1/3;

grid-column: 3;
means box2 the starting vertical line will be line3

grid can overlap each other, look at box1 and box4
